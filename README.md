# item-lister
This project is a simple item lister with a filter search bar

In this project, I built a simple item lister.
This is a serverless project.
The goal is to use Javascript to change list elements dynamically.

Here are the subgoals:
* Add new list items when clicking on a button
* Add a way to delete each items separately
* Make use of events to trigger the adding and the removing functionalities
* Style the list items and buttons dynamically
* Create a way to filter the items in the list
* Sort the list of items alphanumerically
* Create a simple animation for the button that add the items
* Make the app responsive
